I&apos;ll tell you a few things about me so that we can get to know each other. I am 19, born and raised in Sheridan Wyoming and now go to school in Laramie at the University of Wyoming where I am studying Human Nutrition and Food. I am a big fan girl (One Direction isn&apos;t broken up they&apos;re just on a break, and they&apos;ll be back soon!), from movies and TV shows to bands and solo artists, you name it. I am obsessed with wiener dogs and could eat peanut butter for every meal for the rest of my life. I love music and traveling and being outside and that kind of sums me up, well the important stuff at least. Though I might have to clarify one of those statementsâ€¦ while I am a student at the University of Wyoming, I am not currently studying there. I&apos;m actually studying on exchange at the University of South Australia, and I love it! So come join me for the semester :)</p>
